## Usage

Use [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) to access the installation script and set up pnpm:

    curl -L https://unpkg.com/@pnpm/self-installer | node

The above script will install the latest version of pnpm but you may also install
a specific version:

    curl -L https://unpkg.com/@pnpm/self-installer@1.16.2 | node

You can also use a semver range:

    curl -L https://unpkg.com/@pnpm/self-installer@1 | node

Or a tag:

    curl -L https://unpkg.com/@pnpm/self-installer@next | node

**NOTE:** Installation by version or range works from `1.16.2` only.
